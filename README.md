# ðŸ’Ž Diamond Price Prediction

This project predicts the **price of diamonds** based on features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, and table using **machine learning regression models**.  
It demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow: data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Preprocessing of structured data (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical values)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (correlation, distributions, feature importance)  
- Feature engineering to improve prediction accuracy  
- Implementation of multiple regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Model performance comparison using metrics (RÂ² Score, MAE, RMSE)
